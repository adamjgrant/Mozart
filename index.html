      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Not every project needs React or Angular to be zippy and modern.</p>
      <p>After spending years developing <a href="https://getkickstart.com">Kickstart</a> after its third version and thousands of GitHub stars, I started work on Mozart.</p>
      <p>Four years later, I'm ready to release it to the public.</p>

    <article data-attach="basics/create-a-component">
      <h2>Creating a component</h2>
      <p>Every Mozart component is a class that extends the Mozart base class. To enable the most customization, we recommend you always extend the <code>Mozart</code> base class with one called <code>Component</code>.</p>
    </article>

    <article data-attach="basics/methods-added">
      <p>Your new component automatically has a set of methods. You might notice some funny stuff going on there, especially that <code>_$</code> variable. We'll go through each one of these methods and cover that along the way.</p>
    </article>

    <article data-attach="basics/using-css">
      <p>Mozart doesn't provide any tooling at the moment to assist with CSS styling, but then again, you don't really need that overhead anyway.</p>
      <p>Simply use the attirbute selector syntax to easily style only the elements in your component. This is even easier when nesting with SCSS/Sass, or a similar precompiler.</p>
    </article>

    <article data-attach="basics/actions">
      <h2>Actions</h2>
      <p>Actions are stored in a dictionary to allow for calling by name either from within the component or from another.</p>
      <p>The idea of actions is to compartmentalize atomic concerns of your application into named routes.</p>
      <p>This allows you to separate out event-driven logic which we'll cover next, and to make it easy to follow your code as different components talk to one another.</p>
      <h3><code>_$, args</code></h3>
      <p>You may have noticed each method has two arguments, <code>_$</code> and <code>args</code>. When you actually call the action, you can omit the <code>_$</code> as this is added in automatically.</p>
      <p><code>_$</code> is the scoped selector, which we'll talk about a little more in the next section. <code>args</code> can be anything you want. We recommend treating this as a simple JavaScript object for passing any arguments you wish.</p>
    </article>

    <article data-attach="basics/events">
      <h2>Events</h2>
      <p>Events are simply the events that can happen on your component or an element in the component.</p>
      <p>Mozart provides a "scoped selector" to make this easier. You can name it however you want, but we like to use <code>_$</code>.</p>
      <p><code>_$</code> is a pass through for either jQuery's <code>$</code>, or <code>document.querySelectorAll</code> if you're not using it.</p>
      <p>However, it provides an additional function by automatically scoping the query to the component. That's why we're free to be a little reckless here and just refer to the button as <code>button</code>. It's not necessary to use a class or ID here but I could if I wanted to.<p>
      <p>In both examples, this event fires off a <code>generate</code> action. We'll cover actions next, but normally the actions would be referenced with <code>m.generator.acts</code>. This is another helper function <code>_$</code> provides, by giving us a shorthand to the component's own methods.</p>

    <article data-attach="basics/routes">
      <h2>Routes</h2>
      <p>Routes allow you to quickly spin up the right AJAX parameters for an AJAX call given a few parameters.</p>
    </article>

    <article data-attach="basics/config">
      <h2>Config</h2>
      <p>The <code>config</code> method is a convenient way to add configuration values within the component.</p>
    </article>

    <article data-attach="advanced/jquery">
      <h1>Advanced</h1>
      <h2>Using jQuery</h2>
      <p>Mozart will automatically return from jQuery with <code>_$</code> instead of returning just plain JavaScript nodes. Just make sure jQuery is included before Mozart.</p>
      <p>For root methods on jQuery such as <code>$.ajax</code>, continue using <code>$</code> while using <code>_$</code> for component scoped selections.</p>
    </article>

    <article data-attach="advanced/private-methods">
      <h2>Private methods</h2>
      <p>Private methods allow you to define methods only the component itself can reach. Other components will not have access.</p>
