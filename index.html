      <h2>Creating a component</h2>
      <p>Every Mozart component is a class that extends the Mozart base class. To enable the most customization, we recommend you always extend the <code>Mozart</code> base class with one called <code>Component</code>.</p>
    </article>

    <article data-attach="methods-added"> 
      <p>Your new component automatically has a set of methods. You might notice some funny stuff going on there, especially that <code>_$</code> variable. We'll go through each one of these methods and cover that along the way.</p>
    </article>

    <article data-attach="using-css">
      <p>Mozart doesn't provide any tooling at the moment to assist with CSS styling, but then again, you don't really need that overhead anyway.</p>
      <p>Simply use the attirbute selector syntax to easily style only the elements in your component. This is even easier when nesting with SCSS/Sass, or a similar precompiler.</p>
    </article>

    <article data-attach="events">
      <p>Events are simply the events that can happen on your component or an element in the component.</p>
      <p>Mozart provides a "scoped selector" to make this easier. You can name it however you want, but we like to use <code>_$</code>.</p>
      <p><code>_$</code> is a pass through for either jQuery's <code>$</code>, or <code>document.querySelectorAll</code> if you're not using it.</p>
      <p>However, it provides an additional function by automatically scoping the query to the component. That's why we're free to be a little reckless here and just refer to the button as <code>button</code>. It's not necessary to use a class or ID here but I could if I wanted to.<p>
      <p>In both examples, this event fires off a <code>generate</code> action. We'll cover actions next, but normally the actions would be referenced with <code>m.generator.acts</code>. This is another helper function <code>_$</code> provides, by giving us a shorthand to the component's own methods.</p>
